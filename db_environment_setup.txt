A Sample Environment Setup


First, we need to go through the following steps to tell the project we intend to use Derby:

    Go to the Projects tab.
    Right-click the project you want and choose Properties.
    Go to the Libraries tab in the left side of this dialog.
    Choose the Run tab on the right side of this dialog.
    Click the Add JAR/Folder button.
    Locate derby.jar and click Choose.
        On Mac OS X, this may be found at /Applications/NetBeans/glassfish-v3-prelude/javadb/lib/derby.jar.
        On Windows in the default Netbeans installation, this may be found at C:\Program Files\Sun\JavaDB\lib\derby.jar.
        Other possible locations on Windows where the NetBeans installer may have put this driver are:
            C:\Sun\AppServer\javadb\lib\derby.jar
            C:\Program Files\glassfish-3.1.1\javadb\lib

Then, we need to set up the client for Derby by creating a library for it and adding it to the project:

    Go to Tools > Libraries.
    Select New Library... in the lower left of this dialog.
    Enter a Library Name of JavaDB-Network, then choose Add JAR/Folder and browse to find derbyclient.jar. (Look to the same directory location as above.)
    Then go back to the Projects tab.
    Right-click the project you want and choose Properties.
    Go to the Libraries tab in the left side of this dialog.
    Choose the Compile tab on the right side of this dialog this time.
    Click the Add Library button
    Locate the JavaDB-Network library you just created.
    Click OK.
